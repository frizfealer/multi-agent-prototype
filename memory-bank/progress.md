# Project Progress

## 1. What Works

- The entire foundational infrastructure for the Triage Agent system has been implemented.
- All core components (`Orchestrator`, `StateManager`, `AssistantAgent`) are in place.
- The database schema is defined.
- The application is ready to be run via a FastAPI server.
- The `memory-bank` is fully updated.

## 2. What's Left to Build

- Integration testing between the components.
- Implementation of specialist "Coach" agents.
- Deployment to a production environment.

## 3. Current Status

- **Phase 1 (Project Scaffolding & Documentation):** Complete.
- **Phase 2 (Database Implementation):** Complete.
- **Phase 3 (Core Component Development):** Complete.
- **Phase 4 (Configuration & Integration):** Complete.

The project is ready for its first run and testing.

## 4. Known Issues

- The system has not yet been tested with a live PostgreSQL database connection.
- The `hand_off_to_experts` function currently only hands off to the first coach in the list and does not yet support combined prompts.
- A critical bug in the `Orchestrator` that prevented successful handoffs has been fixed.
