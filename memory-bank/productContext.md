# Product Context: AI Assistant

## 1. Problem Solved

Users need a single, intelligent interface to manage complex tasks that may require the expertise of multiple specialized AI agents (e.g., fitness, nutrition). A simple chatbot is insufficient for managing stateful, multi-turn conversations that lead to complex actions. This project solves the problem of routing user intent to the correct agent while maintaining a seamless conversational experience.

## 2. User Experience Goals

- **Conversational Flow:** Users should feel like they are having a single, continuous conversation, even when being handed off between different AI agents.
- **Smart Routing:** The system should intelligently understand the user's needs and engage the correct specialist agent without requiring the user to explicitly ask for it.
- **Efficiency:** The Triage Agent should gather just enough information to make a routing decision, avoiding unnecessary questions and getting the user to their goal faster.
- **Clarity:** The user should be informed when they are being handed off to a specialist, so the change in the AI's focus feels natural.
