# LangGraph Orchestration Architecture Design Proposal

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a **two-level LangGraph orchestration architecture** that combines **async domain workflow dispatch** with **atomic state access** for context aggregation. The design enables non-blocking responsiveness while maintaining sophisticated multi-domain workflow coordination, with **HTTP-first communication** for production simplicity and reliability.

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Strengths
- **Sophisticated SessionManager** with domain-keyed concurrent workflows
- **Comprehensive TriageAgent** with intent classification and confidence scoring
- **Multi-domain ContextAggregator** with domain-specific formatters
- **QueryProcessor** with conversation history and context integration
- **WebSocket** communication infrastructure (evaluation needed for production)

### Complexity Pain Points
- **Manual orchestration logic** in TriageService (~200 lines of routing)
- **Dual state management** (active_workflows dict + LangGraph state)
- **Complex approval workflow tracking** with pending_confirmations dict
- **Synchronous domain workflow execution** blocking main orchestrator

## Proposed Architecture: Async LangGraph Orchestration

### Core Design Principles

1. **Non-blocking Responsiveness**: Main orchestrator launches domain workflows asynchronously and remains available for new requests
2. **Atomic State Access**: Leverage LangGraph's atomic state reads for context aggregation from running workflows
3. **Clean Separation**: Two-level architecture with distinct responsibilities
4. **HTTP-First Communication**: Prioritize HTTP patterns for production simplicity and reliability
5. **Existing Component Preservation**: Maintain investments in SessionManager and business logic

### Two-Level LangGraph System

#### Level 1: Main Intent Orchestrator
**Responsibilities:**
- Intent-based message routing (Query vs Action)
- Human-in-the-loop approval workflows
- Asynchronous domain workflow dispatch
- Query processing with dynamic context from running workflows

**State Schema:**
```python
class IntentState(TypedDict):
    messages: List[BaseMessage]
    session_id: str
    user_message: str
    triage_result: Dict[str, Any]
    approval_status: Optional[str]
    domain_results: Dict[str, Any]
```

**Node Architecture:**
- `triage_agent` → Intent classification and confidence scoring
- `approval_handler` → Human-in-the-loop confirmations (with interruption)
- `query_processor` → Multi-domain context queries with current workflow state
- `domain_launcher` → Async domain workflow dispatch (fire-and-forget)

#### Level 2: Domain-Specific Workflows
**Responsibilities:**
- Complex domain business logic
- Multi-step workflow coordination
- Internal state management and persistence
- Progress tracking and status updates

**Independent LangGraph Instances:**
- `ExercisePlanningWorkflow` → Requirement analysis, research, plan generation
- `FinanceWorkflow` → Risk analysis, compliance checks, transaction execution
- `HRWorkflow` → Document collection, onboarding, approvals
- `ITWorkflow` → Access provisioning, security checks, deployment

### Key Innovation: Async Dispatch + Atomic State Access

#### Async Domain Workflow Launch
```python
async def _domain_launcher_node(self, state: IntentState) -> IntentState:
    """Launch domain workflow asynchronously and return immediately"""
    
    domain = state["triage_result"]["domain"]
    thread_id = f"{session_id}_{domain}"
    
    # Fire-and-forget domain workflow launch
    task = asyncio.create_task(
        self._run_domain_workflow_async(domain, domain_state, thread_id)
    )
    
    # Track but don't wait
    self.running_workflows[thread_id] = task
    
    # Return immediately - main orchestrator stays responsive!
    return state
```

#### Atomic State Reading for Context Aggregation
```python
async def read_domain_workflow_state(self, thread_id: str, domain: str) -> Optional[dict]:
    """Read current state of running domain workflow atomically"""
    domain_workflow = self.domain_workflows[domain]
    config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": thread_id}}
    
    # LangGraph atomic state read - doesn't interfere with execution!
    current_state = await domain_workflow.aget_state(config)
    return current_state.values if current_state else None
```

#### Dynamic Query Processing
```python
async def _query_node(self, state: IntentState) -> IntentState:
    """Query processing with real-time domain workflow context"""
    
    # Get context from ALL currently running domain workflows
    domain_contexts = await self.state_reader.get_all_domain_contexts(session_id)
    
    # Merge with completed workflow context from SessionManager
    full_context = {
        "running_workflows": domain_contexts,      # Current state via atomic reads
        "completed_workflows": completed_contexts  # Historical context
    }
    
    # Process query with current + historical context
    response = await self.query_processor.process_query(query, full_context)
    return state
```

## Communication Architecture: HTTP-First Approach

### HTTP vs WebSocket Analysis

After comprehensive evaluation, **HTTP-only communication** is recommended for production due to superior reliability, simplicity, and compatibility with LangGraph workflows.

#### When HTTP is Sufficient (Your Use Case)
- ✅ **Workflow orchestration** (start task → get status → get results)
- ✅ **Background processing** (exercise planning, financial transactions)
- ✅ **Business applications** (forms, workflows, reports) 
- ✅ **AI/LLM applications** (submit request → process → return result)

#### When WebSocket is Needed (Not Your Use Case)
- **Chat interfaces** requiring immediate back-and-forth
- **Live collaboration** with multiple users editing simultaneously
- **Real-time dashboards** with sub-second updates
- **Gaming** with real-time interactions

### Recommended HTTP Communication Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Immediate Response + Status Polling
```python
# Client submits request
POST /chat
{
    "session_id": "user123",
    "message": "Create a workout plan"
}

# Server responds immediately 
{
    "status": "processing",
    "workflow_id": "wf_456", 
    "estimated_duration": "30-60 seconds",
    "immediate_response": "I'm working on your exercise plan..."
}

# Client polls for progress and results
GET /workflow/wf_456/status
{
    "status": "running",
    "progress": 0.6,
    "current_step": "Researching exercises",
    "partial_results": {...}
}
```

#### Pattern 2: HTTP Long Polling (Enhanced UX)
```python
# Client waits for completion (or timeout)
GET /workflow/wf_456/wait?timeout=60

# Server response when completed
{
    "status": "completed",
    "final_result": "Your 4-week workout plan...",
    "took_seconds": 45
}
```

### HTTP + LangGraph Integration Benefits

| Aspect | HTTP Only | WebSocket |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **LangGraph Compatibility** | ✅ Perfect - no conflicts | ⚠️ Needs bridge patterns |
| **Setup Complexity** | ✅ Simple REST endpoints | ❌ Connection management |
| **Error Handling** | ✅ Standard HTTP patterns | ❌ Connection drops, reconnection |
| **Production Reliability** | ✅ Stateless, battle-tested | ⚠️ Stateful, more edge cases |
| **Scalability** | ✅ Load balancer friendly | ❌ Sticky sessions needed |
| **Update Latency** | ⚠️ 2-3 second polling | ✅ Instant |

### WebSocket Integration Challenges (If Needed Later)

If real-time updates become critical, WebSocket integration requires careful handling:

```python
# ❌ PROBLEMATIC - WebSocket objects in LangGraph state
class IntentState(TypedDict):
    websocket_manager: WebSocketManager  # NOT SERIALIZABLE!

# ✅ SOLUTION - External bridge pattern
class WebSocketBridge:
    async def queue_message(self, session_id: str, message: str):
        """Queue messages for external WebSocket delivery"""
        # Keep WebSocket logic separate from LangGraph workflows
```

**Key WebSocket Risks:**
- **State serialization issues** - WebSocket objects break LangGraph checkpointing
- **Connection lifecycle mismatch** - workflows outlive connections
- **Async context conflicts** - mixed async patterns cause deadlocks

### Recommended Communication Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Start with HTTP-only (immediate benefits, no complexity)
2. **Phase 2**: Add long polling for enhanced UX
3. **Phase 3**: Only consider WebSocket if HTTP proves insufficient

**For workflow orchestration taking 30-60 seconds, HTTP polling every 2-3 seconds provides excellent UX without complexity.**

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Main Orchestrator Migration (HTTP-First)
- Convert TriageService to LangGraph main orchestrator
- Implement approval workflow with human-in-the-loop interruption
- Add async domain workflow dispatch capability
- **Implement HTTP-only communication** (POST /chat, GET /workflow/{id}/status)
- Preserve existing TriageAgent, QueryProcessor, SessionManager integration

### Phase 2: Domain Workflow Conversion
- Convert existing exercise planning workflow to separate LangGraph
- Implement atomic state reading infrastructure
- **Add HTTP status polling and long polling endpoints**
- Test async execution with main orchestrator responsiveness

### Phase 3: Multi-Domain Expansion
- Add finance and HR domain workflows as separate LangGraph instances
- Implement comprehensive context aggregation across all domains
- Add workflow lifecycle management and cleanup
- Performance optimization and monitoring

### Phase 4: Advanced Features

- **Business Logic** - All existing agents (TriageAgent, QueryProcessor, etc.) preserved
- **Message Handling** - Universal message types and conversation management maintained
- **HTTP Infrastructure** - Leverage existing FastAPI endpoints and patterns

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Learning Curve**: Gradual migration allows team to learn LangGraph incrementally
- **Integration Complexity**: Preserve existing interfaces during transition
- **Performance**: LangGraph overhead is minimal, async dispatch improves responsiveness

### Business Risks
- **Feature Continuity**: All existing functionality preserved during migration
- **User Experience**: Improved responsiveness enhances rather than disrupts UX
- **Maintenance**: Reduced complexity decreases long-term maintenance burden

## Conclusion

The proposed **Async LangGraph Orchestration Architecture with HTTP-First Communication** significantly reduces complexity while enhancing capabilities.
